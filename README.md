# python-pipeline-runner

Currently some concepts for a Python data pipeline runner

`dag_approaches` contains a couple of attempts at building a config-driven DAG pipeline runner.

`native_python_example` contains a working example that relies on Python to procedurally validate object references at runtime, instead of building a DAG ourselves.
